# Library of Jenkins v2 helpers #

Jenkinsfile can load external library. The whole process is
described
[there](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin#pipeline-shared-libraries).

This is my own set of helpers. It is a very much work in progress. The
deployment method is the old using the internal git server.

## Usage ##

```shell
git clone https

```
